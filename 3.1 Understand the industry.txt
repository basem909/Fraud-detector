## 1- Explain the money flow and the information flow in the acquirer market and the role of the main players.
As a merchant your site process a payment of the customer following a certain scheme through several main players to process the process of selling the merchant or the service and collect the price adequately and safely.

Firstly the Gateway:
 which is a system responsible for collecting the checkout 'purchase info' and sending this data to the next players in the flow
It is also responsible for receiving the response for the purchase process it initiated to state the success of this purchase or the cancellation
As an intermediary between e-commerce and its payment method used, the gateway acts as a terminal, integrating all the transactions carried out between the players of the payment flow in a single place.
By activating the connectors and registering gateway affiliations, your client's shopping data can be sent to acquirers or other gateways and thus move on through the approval flow in financial institutions.

Secondly the Acquirer (Creditor):
 which is a company that specializes in processing payments on the behalf of the merchant through its acquiring network which enables the merchant to provide several payment methods between debit and credit for their customers
The acquirer receives the payment info sent from the Gateway and passes it forward to the card issuer in case of processing a credit card payment and to the issuer bank in case of processing a debit payment
When everything is in order and a purchase is authorized by the other players within the purchase flow, the acquirer is responsible for transferring the values (which the issuing bank receives from the customer) to the account of your store.
Some examples of acquirers in Brazil are Rede, Cielo, GetNet, and Stone.

The Card Issuer:
 which are companies that issue the credit card and define the regulating rules for payments made by these cards
organize the number of installments and the authorization for national and international markets and so on  (each brand has its own rules). Some examples of card brands are Mastercard, American Express, and Visa.
In the credit card payment flow, the brand receives information about the purchase made in your store from the acquirer. It then validates the conditions (such as the number of installments) and sends the data to the issuing bank, which verifies that the buyer has sufficient limits available. Hence, the card brand serves to both regulate the use of the card and as a bridge between the acquirer and the consumer's bank.


The Issuing Bank:
 which is the financial institution that will receive the payment info and decide whether to authorize or not the transaction based on the credit limit for credit card payment and available resources for debit card payments  If everything is OK, the bank collects the value.
This concept is important because it allows you to set up special conditions for payments made through specific banks. In addition,

Finally The Anti-Fraud:
Which is a system specialized in analyzing the purchases made on websites, to identify fraudulent transactions.
It collects data about the behavior of users and compares them with suspicious patterns to approve or deny the order. The anti-fraud therefore adds an extra layer of security to your store.

So The payments or the checkout that is made at the store initiates a payment process on the gateway that collects the info of the order
then sends it to the acquirer which by its role accredits it through the acquirer network and pass it along to the card brand issuer which does its validations and
then pass the info to the bank which decides on whether to approve the transaction or not if approved the money is collected from the customer to the merchant account if not it is canceled
and in both cases, the response reaches back to the gateway in a matter of very few seconds.


## 2. Explain the difference between acquirer, sub-acquirer, and payment gateway and how the flow explained in question 1 changes for these players.

The Sub-acquirer is kind of an intermediary player between the store and the Acquirer which means that it is a company that processes the payment and transmits the information to the next level of the flow.
It almost does the same job as the acquirer but it can not take the whole job solely because of the lack of autonomy to perform all the functionalities of an acquirer.
Sub-acquirer can be attractive for some merchants because of its low implementation cost, own anti-fraud system, and ease of integration which makes this a very attractive solution for small stores.
Meanwhile, they come at some cost mainly in the high rates charged for each transaction (greater than the acquirers) and the redirection of the customer to the Sub-acquirer's page during the final steps of the checkout, which can lead to higher withdrawal rates.

The Acquirer and The Gateway as we defined before the flow is as it goes the Gateway gathered the payment info from the store 
then it sends the info to the sub acquired which runs it is anti-fraud and accreditation and then passes it to the creditor to finish up the acquire network accreditation and then to the issuer.


## 3. Explain what chargebacks are, how they differ from cancellations, and what their connection is with fraud in the acquiring world.

The Cancelation:
As it means “Canceling” is just canceling the main payment and related order. This method can be considered as deleting the main payment transaction records from the merchant accounting, the issuer, and the acquirer bank (maybe also the intermediary institutions if exist).
As a general rule, the main payment disappears from the customer's bank account once it is canceled, just like never happened.
Usually, the cancel method is available only for the payments accomplished on the same day and only before the day report (z-report). The cancel method has to be called before the accounting process. That is why there is a time restriction both for banks and merchants to use this method.


The Chargeback:
Unlike the cancel and refund methods, the Charge-Back is often utilized for unauthorized payments and unreconciled statuses. This method can be considered as bypassing the merchant by the customers when they could not solve the dispute.
The chargeback is usually triggered by the customer and usually initiates an inspection process by related banks. The merchant may be expected to prove the order is authorized by the customer, and submit some solid evidence like invoices, signatures, shipment records, etc.
In many cases like wide-size cyber-crimes, data leakages, ordering frauds, etc. issuer/acquirer banks, card networks, or payment service providers can request mass chargeback processes. In addition,
The chargeback is usually triggered by the customer and usually initiates an inspection process by related banks. The merchant may be expected to prove the order is authorized by the customer, and submit some solid evidence like invoices, signatures, shipment records, etc.


The Fraud related to chargebacks:
In many cases like wide-size cyber-crimes, data leakages, ordering frauds, etc. issuer/acquirer banks, card networks, or payment service providers can request mass chargeback processes. In addition to these, regulations in almost all countries state that the courts can order chargebacks to banks.
Also, customers sometimes tend to scam the system by trying to initialize a false claimed chargeback just to get the product and the price back.
So it is recommended for merchants and business owners if they are going to take an action against the chargeback to do it as soon as  possible
